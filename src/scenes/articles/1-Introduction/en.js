          New survey reveals the existence of more than 2000 points and 200 illegal mining areas in six Amazonian countries.
        </p>
      </Note>
      <Paragraph>
        Despite decades of combatting unregulated extraction, illegal mining persists and is expanding into a powerful driver of destruction and contamination of the Amazon. The craving for valuable minerals resembles an epidemic, since it occurs everywhere across the rainforest. Although mining has always been a regional activity, its current proliferation is not comparable to any other period of its history.

        The <ExternalLink href="https://www.amazoniasocioambiental.org" language="pt">Amazon Georeferenced Socio-Environmental Information Network (RAISG)</ExternalLink>{" "}, created in 2007, brings together experts from six Amazon countries. They represent eight civil society organizations that permanently update databases detailing the main threats to the Amazon region.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In this unique research, the network seeks to provide an overview of illegal mining throughout the whole Amazonian territory, which covers seven million square kilometres. Its members compiled primary information from partners, analysis of satellite images and news stories published in the six countries up to 2017.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        "The incidence of illegal mining in the Amazon, especially in indigenous territories and natural protected areas, has grown exponentially in recent years with the increase in the price of gold. However, it is one of the pressures least well known. For this reason, RAISG has decided to make it an issue for continuous monitoring, especially for its social and environmental impacts", says Executive Secretary Beto Ricardo.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The mapping has resulted in an online tool that allows you to browse through all the illegal mining sites and areas. The <ExternalLink href="https://mineria.amazoniasocioambiental.org/" language="pt">digital platform contains the available information</ExternalLink>{" "} or each of the sites, areas, or rivers related to the presence of mining, including its current status (active or inactive) and its impact on natural protected areas and indigenous territories.

      <Paragraph>
        Of all the sites mapped, the majority are in Venezuela, followed by Brazil, Ecuador and Peru. In Colombia and Bolivia, analysis was done by rivers, which is why it is not quantified by specific sites. Out of the 245 extraction areas, three are in Bolivia, <StoryMedia

      <Paragraph>
        The data collected by RAISG, however, are a first approximation of the situation, reflecting a problem of unknown magnitude and whose picture represents only a part of what is really happening. The cases reported come from notifications from riverine and indigenous communities, from news gathering and satellite image analysis.
