But there is an invisible evil that contaminates the Amazonian fauna and the inhabitants of the region. According to several studies, mercury is affecting indigenous and local populations who live nearby or work in gold mining areas, as well as those who consume Amazonian fish as part of their diet.

But while fish guarantee a rich and tasty diet, they may also contain threats to the health of these populations. Studies have revealed an accumulation of mercury in several fish species used for human consumption at levels above those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        This metal is bio-accumulative in animal tissue. That is, concentrations of mercury will be higher in fish that feed on smaller fish and its negative effect on humans will be even more intense.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Mercury is used to purify gold. Residues contaminate water and air. Returned to the environment as methylmercury, this element causes serious and highly toxic damage thanks to persistent accumulation. The compound affects the central nervous system, causing problems of sight loss, cognitive and motor impacts, heart disease and other handicaps. Pregnant women and children are the most vulnerable categories.

Subsequently in 2009 and 2010, members of Ye'kwana indigenous group from the Caura, Bolívar and Uwottüja regions, along the Orinoco and in the state of Amazonas, were found to have high levels of mercury in their hair. This situation was replicated in fish in the Paragua and Caroni rivers, according to research in 2009. Thus prior to the massive boom in gold mining, all the main rivers of the Venezuelan Amazon contained fish with high mercury levels.

The book "Mercury in Bolivia: Baseline Uses, Emissions and Pollution", published in 2016 by the ministries of foreign affairs and the environment, states that with the release of 133 tons of mercury a year, Bolivia is the third most contaminated country in the Americas, with 47% coming from gold exploration.
