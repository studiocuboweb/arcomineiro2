          Indigenous communities are exposed to violence and contaminating mining practices in the forgotten southern borderlands of Colombia and Venezuela. In the Amazon, rivers are the highways of the jungle and provide traffickers with an excellent opportunity to transport their merchandise.

        There, amid the jungle humidity, some 5,000 to 10,000 miners dig for gold. But they are not alone. Two Colombian guerrilla groups and corrupt elements of the Venezuelan National Guard are also in control and collect large amounts of the precious metal.

      <Paragraph>
        With the complicity of Venezuelan law enforcement, the environmentally protected Yapacana park is being destroyed by illegal gold mining. In addition, dredges plow the rivers around the park and toxic mercury – used to bind gold flakes – is poisoning the regional water supply.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        A 2017 study found that communities living along Colombia’s Atabapo, Guainía and Inírida rivers, near the Venezuelan mine, had about <ExternalLink href="https://www.eltiempo.com/vida/medio-ambiente/poblacion-de-guania-tiene-niveles-de-mercurio-mas-altos-que-el-promedio-129712" language="es">60 times the maximum safe level of mercury</ExternalLink>{" "} recommended by the World Health Organization. Those three rivers provide much of the water for populations of southern Colombia, Venezuela, and northern Brazil.

        The man runs through a list of the armed groups and corrupt military officials he had to pay off at river checkpoints between Venezuela’s mines and Puerto Inírida:
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        ▪ Five grams, worth as much as 230 U.S. dollars in the international market, to the ‘<i>wachiman</i>’ – watchmen overseeing the miners and reporting to the National Guard or guerrillas;<br />

        Bystreets suddenly disappear in one of the rivers and become docking points where narrow wooden boats can slide in with their cargo, which makes the trade very hard to control. But locals said police prey on the miners. One pawnshop owner said the police are always “impounding” gold, but actually stealing it. “This is an injustice,” he said.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Miners sell their gold at <i>compraventa</i>s</i> – often unmarked shops with tinted windows – found throughout the city. At one anonymous shop with white walls and plastic chairs, a woman was breastfeeding her baby as others were biding their time waiting for their gold to be weighed.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The owner of the <i>compraventa</i>, Bryan, who asked to remain anonymous, sits in a back room where he does his paperwork. He explained that he legally buys gold from Colombian  <i>barequeros</i> – artisanal miners who employ rudimentary methods and are allowed to sell up to 14.8 ounces (420 grams) a year. He has about 200  <i>barequeros</i> registered in his books and hopes to enroll 300 more.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        By registering hundreds, if not thousands, of small artisanal miners, gold vendors like Bryan can justify large quantities of gold sales. But the system is rife with fraud.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Often times the IDs used to justify a mining haul belong to deceased people, or waiters and garage attendants who loan out their IDs in exchange for money, Colombian intelligence said.

      <Paragraph>
        Profit margins are often between one or two U.S. dollars each .03 ounce (a gram). If a trafficker is sent with gold to Bogotá, an owner of a pawn shop explains, quantities above 2.2 pounds (one kilo) are taken to make the trip worthwhile. A courier or smuggler can make about 188 U.S. dollars for carrying a kilo of gold to the capital.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For the authorities, it’s complicated to trace the origins of the gold. Exporters often buy the metal from dozens of shell companies that are difficult, if not impossible, to track down.

        The jungle hinterlands bordering Venezuela are among Colombia’s most impoverished and neglected regions, forcing the communities, historically, to rely on illicit activities for their survival. A lack of opportunities pushed its inhabitants in pendular movements between poaching wild animals for their skin and teeth, illegal mining and the cultivation of the coca plant for cocaine production.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Because unemployment is so high in Guainía, its largely indigenous inhabitants look for work in the Venezuelan mines. An indigenous leader said the situation in Venezuela is even worse. In one community, Caño Grulla, only 30 out of about 500 families remain. Everybody else went to the mines.

        The FARC were the hemisphere’s oldest and largest guerrilla group until they signed a peace deal in 2016 and demobilized in 2017.

        Venezuela has tolerated the presence of Colombian guerrillas since the late President Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999. While the groups are considered terrorist organizations by the United States and Colombia, Chávez called them <ExternalLink href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/chavez-las-farc-no-son-terroristas-nid978386" language="es">“genuine armies” and “insurgent forces with a political goal.”</ExternalLink>{" "}

        According to Eduardo, a 24-year-old indigenous who asked to remain anonymous, the FARC and ELN are present at the mines, wear military clothing and are well armed. They are also the law of the region. Thieves are often executed but even bringing a phone to the mining area, which is forbidden, can lead to a death sentence.

        Even so, miners said the guerrillas are better bosses than the National Guard, because they had a clear set of rules, prohibited alcohol and substance abuse and sometimes stuck up for the community. The Venezuelan military were often more abusive and demanded more of their gold.

        According to a former Venezuelan intelligence officer, the gold collected by the National Guard is flown to Caracas, after a part is already shared between multiple military branches in Amazonas, including the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN), the head of military counterintelligence (DGCIM), the general in charge of the National Guard, and the commander of the regional defense zones, or ZODI.

        Franklin, a 26-year-old 2nd sergeant in Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Guard, spent three and a half years working in the gold mining areas around Puerto Ayacucho.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Franklin, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, said he and other troops watched as his commanders cut deals with the ELN to squeeze local miners. “They would show up in boats, 200, 300 men armed to the teeth, and their leaders would meet with our commanders,” Franklin said. “I had never seen anything like it.” “They [the ELN] are the ones who are truly in control of the mining areas,” he said.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The double authorities in the Yapacana mines, guerrilla and National Guard, are a fragile tandem. Both Venezuelans and Colombians fill up the ranks of the Colombian guerrillas that outgun the military in Amazonas state.

        “Venezuela has an army, which is prepared for absolutely nothing,” the former Venezuelan intelligence officer said. “On the other hand, the ELN is trained, prepared in combat and not afraid of anything.”

        But there have been conflicts. In 2017, the guerrillas almost downed a Venezuelan military helicopter near the Cacique mine in the area of Yapacana with AR-15 rifle. The chopper wasn’t supposed to be there, explained a Venezuelan adolescent. “Now the guerrillas are in charge.”
