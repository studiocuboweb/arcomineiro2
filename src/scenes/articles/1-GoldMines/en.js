        Currently, several criminal elements dominate El Callao and the rest of the Orinoco Mining Arc. According to NGO’s, opposition legislators, and eyewitnesses, dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and members of Colombia’s National Liberation Army (ELN) are present in the mines of Bolívar and neighboring Amazonas state.

        Until recently, the FARC was the largest guerrilla group in Latin America. Based in Colombia and created in 1964 to fight for equal land distribution and the rural poor, it remained a guerrilla movement until it signed a peace deal in 2016. Now  ELN is the biggest guerrilla group on the continent.
