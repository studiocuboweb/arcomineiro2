        In Colombia, understanding indigenous peoples' perceptions of gold is crucial to understanding the views they hold on mining. Gold is a sacred mineral for the indigenous peoples of the Colombian Amazon because, according to tradition, it is the representation of the sun on earth and constitutes the source of life.

To extract the precious mineral, shamans needed to seek permission through cures and payments of tobacco and coca. Large scale extraction of the mineral can cause illness or death for those responsible. From their point of view, such mining is seen by the communities as representing disease, problems and death.

Everything is really good. It is not dangerous. When the white people remove the gold from the earth, they burn it, they stir it around on the fire as if it were flour. This makes smoke come out of it. This creates xawara, which is the smoke of gold. After this xawara wakémi, this "smoke epidemic", spreads across the forest, where the Yanomami live, but also across the white peoples’ lands, everywhere. That's why we're dying. Because of this smoke."

      <Paragraph>
        Despite millennial beliefs about gold, illegal mining activity has permeated the indigenous territories of the Amazon and altered traditional conceptions of this mineral. Some young people even stop acknowledging traditional authorities, reject the teachings of grandparents and traditional knowledge, and abandon schools to devote themselves to mining activity.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In this way, the elders, sages and many leaders of indigenous peoples see the influence of mining activity on their territories as a risk to their cultural integrity, traditional management, local government over their territories and the health of their peoples.

A current estimate is that five thousand prospectors are illegally in the Brazilian portion alone of the Yanomami Indigenous Land.

      <Paragraph>
        Reports from villages on the banks of the Uiracoera indicate that, between 1987 and 1989, the Yanomami managed to count 2,003 barges operating near the Waikás community. When demarcation of the territory was completed in 1991, prospecting was shut down. However, this began to change in 2010, when new barges arrived on the river. Community leaders tried to prevent the reactivation of prospecting, but the intruders refused to leave arguing that the activity represented their only source of subsistence. <StoryMedia

      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        These reports on activities within the Yanomami territory highlight the way illegal mining activities operate. On the Uiracoera river, evidence shows that a barge operates with two teams each working nine-hour shifts. Each team contains six workers, with a day shift and a night shift. In addition to these twelve workers there is a foreman and a cook.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The foreman is in the area with the crew, the barge owner in the city. Few owners have more than one barge and a foreman manages only one barge. About 40% of the gold collected by the barge is divided between the workers and the majority goes to the owner.
