        According to the study published in January 2015 in the journal Environmental Research Letters, there was an acceleration of forest loss at sites identified as gold mining locations. The study indicated a loss of 377 km² between 2001 and 2006, whereas between 2007 and 2013 the loss was 1303 km². The three regions identified as being under the greatest pressure were the forests of the Guiana shield, the humid forests of the southwestern Amazon, and the Xingu and Tapajós forests in Brazil.

However, the illegal situation has become public knowledge as a result of alliances between miners and dissident members of the Colombian guerrillas.

The armed forces stationed in Amazonas state take a large cut. The Bolivarian National Guard, the Navy and the Air Force periodically travel by helicopter to the mines to receive their share.

        The advance of mining into the protected areas of the Tapajós basin occurred at a time when the Brazilian government was attempting to pass laws to weaken protection measures. Such destruction also occurs because the responsible government agencies, such as IBAMA (environmental management) and ICMBio (protected areas) are unable to combat it. A report published by Intercept Brazil in June the same year showed how <ExternalLink href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/13/governo-esta-prestes-a-aprovar-projetos-a-favor-de-grilagem-e-outros-crimes-ambientais/" language="pt">loggers in alliance with prospectors destroyed bridges to prevent access by inspection teams</ExternalLink>.

      <Paragraph>
        Much of the illegal mining of gold and coltan in the Colombian Amazon takes place in major river basins, such as the Putumayo, Caquetá, Apaporis, Guainía and Inírida, and other smaller water courses, such as the Cotuhé and Puré rivers and the Tatu canyon. These activities affect special management areas (indigenous lands, national parks, Ramsar sites and Forest Reserves) and frontier areas of great cultural and environmental importance, or that play an important role in the food sovereignty of local populations.
